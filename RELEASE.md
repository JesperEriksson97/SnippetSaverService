## Assignment report

_In the assignment report, you reflect on your assignment. You can write in English or Swedish._

### Reflection

I thought the assignment was very well designed. It was pretty hard and challenging but you learned a LOT when working with it.
Previously we have learned about css, html, javascript, web-servers, databases, browsers, http request, security etc.
Now we had to make it all work together. This gave me a better insight of how a real production application is working "under the hood".
_Your own thoughts on the assignment. What was hard, what have you learned? What could you have done differently?_

### Further improvments

At first i misunderstood the "code snippet" part of the assignment. I spent a lot of time to try to make it so that you could actually compile code in the
application which was a bit more complicated and time consuming that i thought, before changing it to just a textarea that lets the user write multilined text and save it
to a database
_Further improvements of the assignment. What could you have done, but did not have the time to complete?_

### Extras

I have implemented a section that's called "My Snippets" that lets a user view their own snippets. I'm not sure if it falls unde the criteria:

"Add support for just showing snippets that's belongs to one tag or/and one user."

In a way it does, but I think this was meant as some kind of "search" functionality were you could search for different users and get their snippets.
_Have you done anything more than the requirements?_

### Feedback

Overall a good assignment and it was really fun to work with. However, as a UDM student this course were pretty hard since we haven't really worked
with JavaScript since 1dv022 which required a lot of "relearning". I would prefer it to have been placed somewhat earlier in the program were javascript were still fresh.
